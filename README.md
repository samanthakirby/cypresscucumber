# Cypress with BDD
My personal feeling is that Cypress reads like BDDs that solved the issue of automation tests not being easy to understand for non-technical individuals.

In my many, many, many years of experience, not once has a PO or BA ever wanted to get involved in automation testing, so I find this added layer and complexity to not be a real world requirement that adds development time for the devs/QAs writing them, and increased run time.
